# virtual-self-driving-car

Using Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Learning to make our car learn by experimentation. we setup the environment using kivy( a python package)
the car is given rewards for each step to make it learn depending upon its move
the car moves from the top left to bottom right of the screen. we can draw sand on the screen
the car has 3 sensors difining the right front and left movements and orientation of the car.

we use the neural networks and deep Q Learning to form the brain of the car in ai.py file and setup the environment and use the brain in the map.py
